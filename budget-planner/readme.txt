# Budget Planner
A project budget planner prototype application was implemented.
In the planner each manager can enter their requested services from external vendor companies and the required budget for them.
The financial team can then accept or deny each item and the total project budget is automatically calculated at the end of the budget table.

The technologies used are pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS with Bootstrap 5 as a css styling library.
The data in the planner is not persisted to add this functionality to the application a backend needs to be implemented saving the data persistently.
