# Portfolio Assessment
The my portfolio site was build using the latest version of Angular and Bootstrap.
A simple main layout has been implemented which proviced a consistent, responsive navigation accross the different pages.
The login and register forms were both implemented using reactive forms and basic validation for ths different fields has already been implemented.
The actual requests that would be send to login or register are at the moment simply mocked with an alert message.
