# Building A Restaurant Website With Bootstrap
The website build contains 5 main section:
- a navbar with links to the different section of the page
- a carrousel with some pitcures to make the site look atractive
- a menu build using the bootstrap grid
- an order button
- a footer with a mock contact form

The page was build using Bootstrap 5 and has some small additional css additions to adapt the bootstrap design.
The original bootstrap theme was used as this is a good starting point which at a later point should be adapted using SASS.
The grid used is responsive so that the menu adapts to the screen size and is always easy to read.
The mocked contact form does not have any real functionality as this would require some kind of backend to handle the data.
